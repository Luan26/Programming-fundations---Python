# Programming-fundations---Python

## This code is to find the GCD of two numbersL

def gcd(a,b):

	t1=max(a,b)#it will compare which one of both isbigger
	t2=min(a,b)#it will compare which onw of both is lower

	while(t2!=0): # t2 is the GCD number, so while it is still being different than zero, it will be divided by the remaing number of division
		d=t1
		t1=t2
		t2=d%t1

	return t1

a=int(input("Type the value of A: "))
b=int(input("Type the value of B: "))
print(gcd(a,b))
